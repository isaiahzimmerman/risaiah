given:
poker hand
number of people
cards on board
additional cards?

find:
odds that player's hand is the best at the table

solution:
use math to find the player's odds of winning
compare player's with every other possible hand
return amount of hands that player wins over total hands
    pros: would theoretically work
    cons: this needs to run through a lot of different possiblities

example:
    player cards = x, y
    2 other players
    leaving 50 possible cards in deck
    nCr, n=50, r=2, leaves 1225 possible hands for opponents
    additionally, 50 C 5, for the amount of cards which will be placed on the board is 2.11876 E+6
    for each hypothetical hand, (2 cards * amt. players), there would be:
    ((50 - 2 * amt of players) C 5) * (50 C (amount of players * 2)), or every combination of 5 cards having to be compared to every possible hand that any player could have
    amt of other players = x
    (50-2x)C(5) * (50)C(2x)
    for 2 others:
        3.157 E 11 comparisons
    for 3 others:
        1.726 E 13 comparisons
    for 4 others:
        4.567 E 14 comparisons
    capping out at 11 others:
        8.722 E 18 comparisons
            assuming a million comparisons per second, this leaves the time for computation at 275 years
    even with only 2 people and assuming the unrealistic speed of a million comparisons per second, it would still take upwards of 3 days to compute.
